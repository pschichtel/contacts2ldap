# contacts2ldap

This is a simple tool that reads contact information from a source and transforms them into LDAP entries. This is useful to use to make the contacts available to [Snom phones as a phonebook](https://service.snom.com/display/wiki/LDAP+Directory).

Currently the only supported source as is the [Sipgate API](https://www.sipgate.io/)
